module: rancher_login
short_description: Log in to Rancher
description:
- This module is implemented entirely as an B(action plugin), that
  runs on the Ansible controller.

- This action plugin retrieves Kubernetes-style credentials (i.e.
  C(kubeconfig) files) from the Rancher back-end. It B(does not)
  revalidate pre-existing credentials, or store them to disk. It
  behooves the calling role or playbook to take care of both; see
  EXAMPLES.

- >
  This action plugin first connects over ssh to the node where the
  Rancher front-end is running (as deduced from the
  C(ansible_rancher_url) variable). It then generates an
  authentication token as a C(kind: Token) object with a very short
  expiration time if required; and finally it uses that to request the
  “child” cluster's kubeconfig from the Rancher backend, like the Web
  UI would.

- 💡 This action plugin obtains credentials over ssh,
  regardless of your C(ansible_connection) setting; and you should
  therefore set either the C(ansible_user) or the C(ansible_ssh_user)
  variable to specify the remote username to connect as (even though
  the rest of your playbook may not make use of that variable).

- "This action plugin reads from the following Ansible variables:"

- C(ansible_rancher_cluster_name)
- The default for the C(cluster_name) task argument

- C(ansible_rancher_url)
- The hostname portion of that URL
  indicates the host to ssh into to
  obtain credentials

- C(ansible_rancher_validate_certs)
- (Boolean) Whether to authenticate the TLS server. Setting this to false B(is insecure).
  At least one of C(ansible_rancher_validate_certs) or C(ansible_rancher_ca_cert) must be set.

- C(ansible_rancher_ca_cert)
- The CA certificate to validate the Rancher TLS server, as a string in multiline
  PEM format.

- C(ansible_rancher_username)
- The Rancher username that the
  retrieved credentials will belong to;
  defaults to “admin”

- C(ansible_rancher_token_stem)
- The prefix of the short-lived bearer token that this action plugin
  creates for itself in order to download the (longer-lived)
  credentials in kubeconfig format. The tokens remain visible forever
  (we think ?) with C(kubectl get token) in the C(local) cluster, even
  though they expire after two minutes.

options:
  cluster_name:
    description: >
      The name of the cluster (the one you see in the
      “name” column on the Rancher dashboard). Defaults
      to the value of the C(ansible_rancher_cluster_name)
      variable.
