# Version 0.7.0: major bugfix and API change release

- Upgrade to latest version of `epfl_si.actions`, thereby gaining `delegate_to:` support in all tasks
- Drop `epfl_si.rancher.rke2_access` role, as it was unused and at odds with 0.6.0's strategy of not managing kubeconfig files anymore
- `epfl_si.rancher.rke2-node` role
- `epfl_si.rancher.rancher_project` lookup plugin

# Version 0.6.0: major bugfix and API change release

- Remove responsibility for creating / maintaining kubeconfig files.
  The `epfl_si.rancher.rancher_login` action now provides a `.kubeconfig`
  field in its `register`ed structure; it's up to you to write that
  into a file (should you choose to)
- Fix: do not insist on `import yaml` working on the remote side.
- Document `epfl_si.rancher.rancher_login` in full i.e. that action
  plugin is ready for prime-time.

# Version 0.5.0: major bugfix and API change release

- `epfl_si.rancher.rke2` connection plugin is gone
- Fix bugs and get rid of dead code

# Version 0.4.0: major feature release

- `rancher_login` can now log in to multiple clusters.
- Fix a Python interpreter mis-discovery bug (whence the interpreter discovered over ssh would ‚Äúleak‚Äù over to normal connections)

# Version 0.3.1: major bugfix release

- Turn off Ansible's Python interpreter discovery when running tasks on the Rancher back-end machine.

# Version 0.3.0: major feature release

- `rancher_registration` now works before initializing the cluster (DUH!). As a consequence, it now requires `rancher_manager_url` and `cluster_name` parameters.

# Version 0.2.1: major feature release

üí° Upload of version 0.2.0 to Galaxy was botched for some reason.

- New `rancher_registration` task
